  ## Description

  For challenge 19 `Text Editor` I added onto the starter code to create a text editor that the user can use in their browers, or download it to use offline. The only updated a few files from the starter code, the `webpack` file, the `service worker` file, the `install.js` file, the `database.js` file, and a few of the `package.json` files. Other than that, the starter code mostly did everthing else. For some reason the `webpack` pulls in the `logo.png` file fine and the icons are in the `dist` folder but when the code is running, the logo does not display and I could not figure out why. The text editor also does not display the header. I used Google, previous activies to help with creating a `manifest` file, and how to create a `service worker`, and previous Zoom recorders while changing the starter code. I also used this: `https://web.dev/codelab-make-installable/`, which help me understand how to install the `PWA`. I think after this challenge I understand `webpack` and `PWA's` although to fully understand them I will need to use them more. 

  This application is a text editor that the user can either use in their browers like Chrome, or download the application and use it offline. The user can use this text editor to take notes, write code, or do anything that you could think of while using a basic text editor.
